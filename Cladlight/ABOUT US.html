	CladLight is a company that specialises in producing wearing technologies to solve or reduce some of the challenges we face day to day. The name "Clad" means clothes. <br>Our first product is the Smart Jacket that will reduce number of motorcycle related accidents due to poor visibility.This is a brain child of two brothers, Charles and Joseph Muchene.
</p>


<p>
	According to a report by World Health Organization statistics puts the number of Kenyans who die in traffic accidents at between 3000-13000 per year most of whom are pedestrians,<br> motorcyclists and cyclists. This is largely attributed to low visibility. CladLight expects to reduce these accidents by 30 percent. This steep rise in deaths from motorcycle accidents<br> prompted the duo to come up with this ingenious idea to save lives.
</p>


<p>
	The Smart Jacket is created by adding flash lights on reflector jackets. The jacket is connected wirelessly to an on board transmitter mounted on the motorbike such that when the <br>operator is turning left or Right the Smart Jacket lights according to the turn. The jacket is equipped with transmitters and a rechargeable battery. The components design has been <br>improved to allow ease of use even when an operator is riding the motorbike. It will be trendy and we are also adding a twist of fashion. CladLight's success means one thing,<br> Saving of lives.
</p>


<p>
	CladLight have dedicated their business towards the health and safety of everyday pedestrians of Kenya. Statistically, 3000-13000 Kenyan lives are lost in traffic accidents each year.<br> Most of these victims are cyclists, motorcyclists or pedestrians. This presents a grim picture in what has become a popular means of transport in both rural and urban areas as well <br>as a source of income especially for the youth.
</p>


<p>
	Thus the introduction of Cladlight's new technological product in which the customer quite literally wears a technology jacket coined the "smart jacket" will help to reduce<br> the amount of road accidents by an estimated 30%.  Simple in its design, the CladLight jacket is tailored towards the everyday pedestrian.  "The jackets have a modified reflector <br>that is equipped with light-emitting diode indicators operated by the motorcyclists to show the direction they are about to turn. It also includes the hazards feature that sees both <br>side lighters flash simultaneously and ultimately the brakes lights. The indicators have an independent source of power, make use of wireless control and are integrated into the <br>motorcycle's indication system."

<p>
	The two brothers  and founders Joseph Muchene and Charles Muchene say the "smart jacket" will be released for purchase in early March. Having only pitched the concept<br> in late 2013 to Sam Gichuru, the CEO of business accelerator hub Nailab, such a rapid development in manufacturing proves the significant positive impact such a product will have<br> on the Kenyan motor community.Below is Our startup @CladLight being demonstrated to @AMB_A_Mohammed at ICGLR;
